There are many models for **clustering** out there.  Despite its simplicity, the **K-means** is vastly used for clustering in many data science applications, it is especially useful if you need to quickly discover insights from **unlabeled data**. In this notebook, you will learn how to use k-Means for customer segmentation.

Some real-world applications of k-means:

*   Customer segmentation
*   Understand what the visitors of a website are trying to accomplish
*   Pattern recognition
*   Machine learning
